<p>Bruce Bay Beans and Bunks, formerly known as the Bruce Bay Coffee Cart, is a small family-owned business situated on the Haast Highway between Haast and Fox Glacier. The business is transitioning from a mobile coffee cart to a permanent building that will also offer simple lodging. Despite the scenic location and quality offerings, the business currently relies on an outdated, in-person only model for handling orders. As it grows, the company aims to better serve its customers, who are primarily tired tourists seeking a convenient way to pre-order coffee and snacks during their journey.</p>
