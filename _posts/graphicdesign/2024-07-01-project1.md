<p>The concept of the trademark is designed for a honeycomb grid paving product. To generate ideas, I researched various aspects such as the shape of the product and its colors. I then integrated these elements with themes of 'building,' 'abstract,' 'outline,' 'simplified,' and 'color' to create the draft design.</p>
