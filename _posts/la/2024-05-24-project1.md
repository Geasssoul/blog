<p>This project aims to maintain the site's amenities and improve a temporary landscape area. The temporary landscape area will be carefully created as a clean and enjoyable space for public.
<br><br>
The primary considerations for selecting plants are "easy maintenance, fast growth, and good drainage."
<br><br>
The project involves landscape design, landscape specifications, and a year of maintenance to ensure the plants are well-established.</p>
