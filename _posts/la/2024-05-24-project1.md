<div class="cust-p">
  This project aims to maintain the site's amenities and improve a temporary landscape area. The temporary landscape area will be carefully created as a clean and enjoyable space for public.
  <br><br>
  The primary considerations for selecting plants are "easy maintenance, fast growth, and good drainage."
  <br><br>
  The project involves landscape design, landscape specifications, and a year of maintenance to ensure the plants are well-established.
