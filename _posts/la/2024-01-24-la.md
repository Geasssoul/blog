<div class="cust-p">
This project was designed in collaboration with the client to create a rich and engaging landscape that meets their expectations. The design features a tropical theme, incorporating a variety of tropical plants, Carex, Phormium, and driftwood to evoke a lush tropical atmosphere. Integrated lighting enhances the visual appeal, while also providing pedestrians with a beautifully designed landscape experience.
