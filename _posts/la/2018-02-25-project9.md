<p>Designing for the aging population requires incorporating inclusive design principles to ensure accessibility and enhance the overall experience. By considering factors such as hearing, vision, and physical movement, the goal is to create a space that promotes independence, accessibility, and a sense of belonging for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or age.</p>
