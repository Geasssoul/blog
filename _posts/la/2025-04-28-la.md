<div class="cust-p">
As the project was not executed in accordance with the specified requirements for the house and landscaping, it resulted in complaints. In response, we evaluated the existing site conditions and worked with the client to develop a revised solution for the front yard. The updated design includes the addition of hedges and a specimen tree to enhance privacy between the front yard and the street.
