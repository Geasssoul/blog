<h3>Our issues while working on the project</h3>
<p>1.Since we are a small team with only 2 members, we have discussed with the product owner and agreed to focus only on high-priority tasks, according to our team's ability. Additional features will be considered based on time availability. Any related to the instructor and one-on-one lessons will be considered low priority.
<br><br>
2.Lacking a background in IT, resolving bugs has required additional time and effort.</p>
