<p>Lincoln University would like to replace the existing fixed maps with a physical interactive digital map portal. Based on their requriment I have develop a serise Interactive Prototype.</p>
<div class="sub-title">Users</div>
<p>The prototype can be student (international), staff, visitors and disabled also open to the public.</p>
<div class="sub-title">Extra Function to be Added</div>
<p>Able to switch different languages, and an AI function for providing help to disabled.</p>
<div class="sub-title">Interactive Methods</div>
<p>In this prototype, I have considered several interactive methods, e,g: a music player when in low power mode, AI mode, phone call, camera, sensor and a game to engage with different users.</p>
