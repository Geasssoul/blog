                I hold a Bachelor's degree in Landscape Architecture. Currently, I am broadening my horizons by
                pursuing a Master of Applied Computing at Lincoln University. My exploration of the IT field has
                enhanced my understanding of technology and future trends, fostering a curiosity and eagerness to
                learn about new developments. This interdisciplinary journey has equipped me with a unique blend
                of creative and technical skills, allowing me to approach problems with both artistic insight and
                logical analysis.
                <br><br>
                In my landscape journey, I have gained experience across China and New Zealand, which has enriched me
                with a diverse array of challenges. These experiences have shaped both my creative and practical
                abilities,
                enhancing my deep understanding of the landscape industry.
                <br><br>
                While learning about IT, I developed a particular interest in front-end development and databases, which
                allows me to combine my design background with technical together.

                    <li>Teamwork:
                        As a team player, adept at providing support and building strong collaborative relationships
                        with teams. Possessing problem-solving abilities and adaptability, I thrive in diverse work
                        environments and

                    <li>Communication:
                        Strong communication skills, proactively engaging with teams, valuing their insights
                        and perspectives, and ensuring that we synergize our efforts effectively towards shared

                        As the saying goes, "If you fail to plan, then plan to fail." I prioritize tasks according
                        to their due dates and the priorities set by the product owner. I also allocate spare time to
                        review
                        projects
                        to ensure they are finished on time and functioning properly. Effective time management not only
                        ensures timely
                        completion of tasks but also helps me cope with stress and perform well under pressure.</li>
