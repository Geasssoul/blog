                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The countryside community swimming club situated in a small rural township and run by the local rural community for the local rural community. The club is formed by functional complex featuring with a small of two swimming pools:
- Deep Pool: A various aqua aerobics classes.
- Land Pool: One on one swimming lessons.
The club's activities revolve around aqua aerobics and personalized swimming lessons, and it operates on a membership basis to serve its client.
<br /><br />
<h2>Project Issue</h2>
<p>Currently, the club are facing the challenges with its manual management system, which may lead to inefficiency, errors, management and other problems in the daily management of the club.</p>
<br /><br />
<h2>Project Aim</h2>

<br /><br />
<h3>Our issues while working on the project</h3>
<p>1.Since we are a small team with only 2 members, we have discussed with the product owner and agreed to focus only on high-priority tasks, according to our team's ability. Additional features will be considered based on time availability. Any related to the instructor and one-on-one lessons will be considered low priority.
<br /><br />
2.Lacking a background in IT, resolving bugs has required additional time and effort.</p>
<br /><br />
<h2>Project Goal</h2>
<p>Given the constraints of a small team comprising only two members and the completion of high-priority tasks, the project's overarching goal remains focused on delivering essential functionalities to improve operational efficiency within the Countryside Community Swimming Club. Despite limitations, the project aims to achieve the following objectives:
<br /><br />

3.
