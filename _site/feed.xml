<div class="sub-title">Project Overview</div>
<p>Bruce Bay Beans and Bunks, formerly known as the Bruce Bay Coffee Cart, is a small family-owned business situated on the Haast Highway between Haast and Fox Glacier. The business is transitioning from a mobile coffee cart to a permanent building that will also offer simple lodging. Despite the scenic location and quality offerings, the business currently relies on an outdated, in-person only model for handling orders. As it grows, the company aims to better serve its customers, who are primarily tired tourists seeking a convenient way to pre-order coffee and snacks during their journey.
<br /><br />
The business currently faces several challenges. The existing business model restricts Bruce Bay Beans and Bunks' ability to expand and effectively cater to its customers' needs. Without an online system, customers are limited to placing orders in person at the shop, which can be inconvenient. Additionally, manually keeping track of stock levels is challenging and time-consuming, increasing the risk of overstocking or running out of popular items. The shift to offering lodging necessitates the implementation of an online system to manage accommodation bookings.
<br /><br />
To address these issues and facilitate business growth, the project aims to develop a user-friendly online system that allows customers to browse and order food, drinks, and merchandise, and book accommodation effortlessly. This system will streamline the management of orders and bookings, reducing errors and saving time. It will also automate inventory management, enabling real-time tracking of stock levels to ensure popular items are always available while minimising overstock issues. The integration of a secure payment gateway will include GST and support promotion code usage, enhancing customer convenience. Additionally, the system enables various administrative tasks such as account management, promotional activities, and comprehensive reporting, thus reducing the administrative load on staff and improving operational efficiency.
<br /><br />
By addressing these goals, the project aims to solve the current challenges faced by Bruce Bay Beans and Bunks, ensuring a better experience for both customers and staff, and supporting the business's growth and success.</p>]]></content><author><name>8010</name></author><category term="IT" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Click to action demo (Pythonanywhere has a time limit, and the link may not work): Bruce Bay Beans and Bunks Click to Github Link Project Overview Bruce Bay Beans and Bunks, formerly known as the Bruce Bay Coffee Cart, is a small family-owned business situated on the Haast Highway between Haast and Fox Glacier.

<div class="sub-title">Project Overview</div>
<p>The countryside community swimming club situated in a small rural township and run by the local rural community for the local rural community. The club is formed by functional complex featuring with a small of two swimming pools:</p>
<p>- Deep Pool: A various aqua aerobics classes.</p>
<p>- Land Pool: One on one swimming lessons.</p>
<p>The club's activities revolve around aqua aerobics and personalized swimming lessons, and it operates on a membership basis to serve its client.</p>
<div class="sub-title">Project Issue</div>
<p>Currently, the club are facing the challenges with its manual management system, which may lead to inefficiency, errors, management and other problems in the daily management of the club.</p>
<div class="sub-title">Project Aim</div>
<p>In order to streamline the operational efficiency, the club seeks to a develop and a management system that will facilitate a seamless interaction among members, instructors, and club managers. Streamlining the booking processes for aqua aerobics classes and swimming lessons, managing members subscriptions, enable instructors with scheduling capabilities, financial tracking, and allow managers to oversee the club’s activities effectively.</p>
<div class="sub-title">Our issues while working on the project</div>
<p>1.Since we are a small team with only 2 members, we have discussed with the product owner and agreed to focus only on high-priority tasks, according to our team's ability. Additional features will be considered based on time availability. Any related to the instructor and one-on-one lessons will be considered low priority.</p>
<p>2.Lacking a background in IT, resolving bugs has required additional time and effort.</p>
<div class="sub-title">Project Goal</div>
<p>Given the constraints of a small team comprising only two members and the completion of high-priority tasks, the project's overarching goal remains focused on delivering essential functionalities to improve operational efficiency within the Countryside Community Swimming Club. Despite limitations, the project aims to achieve the following objectives:</p>
<p>1.
Core Functionality Implementation:
Prioritize the development and implementation of high priority features essential for streamlining club operations.</p>
<p>2.
Operational Efficiency Enhancement:
Optimize existing manual processes by automating critical functions, including aqua aerobics class bookings and member subscription management, to minimize errors and improve overall efficiency.</p>
<p>3.
User Experience Improvement:
Enhance the user experience by providing members with intuitive interfaces for accessing club services, booking classes, and managing subscriptions, engaging members' satisfaction.</p>
<p>4.
Adaptability and Scalability Consideration:
Design the system with flexibility and scalability in mind to accommodate future growth and expansion.</p>]]></content><author><name>8010</name></author><category term="IT" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Click to action demo (Pythonanywhere has a time limit, and the link may not work): Swimming Club Demo Click to Github Link Project Overview The countryside community swimming club situated in a small rural township and run by the local rural community for the local rural community.
